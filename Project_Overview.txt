Project Overview Document - CBS Uren Registratie System
------------------------------------------------------

**Project Purpose:**
The CBS Uren Registratie System is a comprehensive time management application designed to log hours, manage projects, and facilitate user authentication. It supports multiple user roles including administrators and workers, providing tailored functionalities to each group.

**Key Functionalities:**
1. **Time Logging:** Users can log time entries, specifying the hours worked on different projects on particular days. This is critical for tracking productivity and project progress.
2. **User Authentication:** The system includes robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring that user access is secure and role-based.
3. **Project Management:** Administrators have the ability to manage project details, oversee project statuses, and access comprehensive reports.
4. **Role-Based Access:** The application provides different interfaces and functionalities based on user roles, such as admin and worker dashboards.

**Architecture:**
The application is built using the Microsoft .NET MAUI framework, which allows for cross-platform functionality across Windows, Android, and iOS devices. The project includes:
- Models that define data structures.
- Views that handle user interactions.
- ViewModels that connect the views with the models, following the MVVM design pattern.
- Services that handle business logic and database operations.

**Key Components:**
- **DatabaseService:** Manages all interactions with the SQLite database, handling CRUD operations for user and time log entries.
- **AuthService:** Responsible for user authentication, ensuring secure login and session management.
- **Views and ViewModels:** Each view paired with a ViewModel provides a specific functionality, from logging time to managing projects and user settings.

**Usage Scenarios:**
- A worker logs into the system, views their dashboard, and enters hours worked on a specific project.
- An administrator logs in to access user management functionalities, adjust project parameters, and view reports on time logs and project progress.

This document aims to provide a clear understanding of the CBS Uren Registratie System, detailing its purpose, architecture, and functional capabilities.
